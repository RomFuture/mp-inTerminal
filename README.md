Project Overview
Terminal Beats is a lightweight MP3-player that runs entirely in your Windows terminal.
It provides:

Minimalist ASCII UI with logo, playlist, and real-time bar-style visualization.

Essential controls – Next ▶️, Stop ⏹, Previous ⏮, Exit ❌ – all navigable from the keyboard.

Live playback info – filename and elapsed/remaining time shown beneath the player.

Simple config – remembers the last music folder you pointed it to.

Installation
Grab the executable
Download the latest TerminalBeats.exe from the repository (or Releases tab).

Run the installer / EXE
Double-click the file. No additional dependencies are required.

Choose your music folder
On first launch you’ll be asked for the path to the directory with your .mp3 files.
(You can change it later by editing config.json or re-launching with a new path.)

Enjoy!
The player starts immediately. Use the on-screen keys to skip, stop, or exit.
